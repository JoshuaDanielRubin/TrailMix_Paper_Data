# TrailMix Data Repository

This repository contains experiment data for the paper "**TrailMix: Mixture Proportion and Placement Estimation of Ancient Hominin mtDNA Samples using a Pangenomic Reference**". The paper introduces and evaluates **TrailMix**, a tool designed for phylogenetic placement and mixture proportion estimation from hominin mitochondrial aDNA mixture samples.
Please note that some files (e.g. MCMC trace or result files) are above the GitHub file size limit and were therefore not uploaded. Of course all data is available upon request.
